- name: DBAR-DATA (Big Earth Data)
  focus: The technical foundation. This group focuses on data standards, sharing protocols, and the interoperability of datasets across the Belt and Road. It oversees the CASEarth cloud infrastructure to ensure that data from different countries can be merged and analysed centrally.

- name: DBAR-HiMAC (High Mountain and Cold Regions)
  focus: One of the most strategically significant groups. It monitors glaciers, snow cover, and permafrost in the "Third Pole" (Himalayas) and the Arctic. This group is the scientific engine behind China’s Polar Silk Road ambitions.

- name: DBAR-HERITAGE (Natural and Cultural Heritage)
  focus: Focused on the "Soft Power" of the Silk Road. It uses satellite imagery to monitor and preserve UNESCO World Heritage sites at risk from climate change or human conflict. This is a primary entry point for collaboration with European archeological and cultural institutions.

- name: DBAR-WATER (Water Resources)
  focus: Analyses water scarcity, river basin management, and drought. It is particularly active in Central and South Asia (e.g., the Indus and Mekong basins), providing the data used for "Water Diplomacy" and transboundary resource management.

- name: DBAR-AGRI (Agriculture and Food Security)
  focus: Focused on "Zero Hunger" (SDG 2). It uses Earth observation to estimate crop yields, monitor pest outbreaks, and manage land use. This group maps directly to centres in agricultural hubs like Thailand and Zambia.

- name: DBAR-COAST (Coastal and Marine)
  focus: Monitors the "Maritime Silk Road." It tracks sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and mangrove health. It serves as the scientific link for port cities and island nations involved in the Blue Economy.

- name: DBAR-URBAN (Sustainable Cities)
  focus: Tracks the rapid urbanisation of the Belt and Road. It uses "Nighttime Lights" data and urban heat map modelling to analyse how cities are expanding and where infrastructure is most needed.

- name: DBAR-DISASTER (Disaster Risk Reduction)
  focus: Focuses on "Space-to-Ground" disaster management. It provides rapid-response satellite mapping for earthquakes, floods, and landslides, positioning China as a primary provider of emergency data to developing nations.

- name: DBAR-ENVI (Environmental Change)
  focus: The "Climate" group. It monitors carbon sinks, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem health. It bridges the gap between local environmental policy and global climate targets like the Paris Agreement.
