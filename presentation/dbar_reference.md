# DBAR: Big Earth Data for Sustainable Development
### A Scientific Initiative for the UN SDGs

---

# 1. What is DBAR?

The **Digital Belt and Road (DBAR)** is a flagship international scientific initiative launched in 2016 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

- **Objective**: To promote Earth observation and Big Data science for sustainable development.
- **Goal**: Support the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda (SDGs).
- **Scope**: Data sharing, academic exchange, and capacity building across the "Belt and Road" region.

# 2. Key Distinctions

It is critical to distinguish DBAR from other "Belt and Road" pillars:

| Pillar | Focus | Primary Actors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BRI** (Belt and Road Initiative) | Physical Infrastructure | SOEs, Banks, Governments |
| **DSR** (Digital Silk Road) | Digital Economy & Tech | Tech Giants (Huawei, Alibaba) |
| **DBAR** (Digital Belt & Road) | **Science & Big Earth Data** | **Scientific Academy (CAS)** |

# 3. Governance: The Role of CBAS

The **International Research Centre of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (CBAS)** serves as the backbone of the programme.

- **Status**: Permanent Secretariat and Headquarters located in Beijing.
- **Function**: Coordinates the international network of 59+ countries.
- **Infrastructure**: Provides the cloud computing power and data repositories supporting DBAR's scientific capabilities.

# 4. Regional Network: The ICoEs

The **International Centres of Excellence (ICoEs)** function as the regional hubs of the programme.

- **Structure**: 9 active/planned centres worldwide (e.g., Helsinki, Bangkok, Potenza).
- **Function**: Regional data nodes that translate global satellite data into local decision-making tools.
- **Role**: Facilitate knowledge transfer and host thematic Working Groups (HiMAC, Disaster, Heritage).

# 5. Summary: A Socio-Technical Network

- **Factual Backbone**: Anchored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- **Standardisation**: Drives global standards for Big Earth Data.
- **Impact**: Provides "Public Goods" in the form of environmental and developmental data.
