## Conceptual Taxonomy: Infrastructure, Economy, and Science

To analyse the DBAR Knowledge Hub accurately, it is necessary to distinguish between the three primary pillars of Chinese global engagement within the Belt and Road framework:

| Domain | Pillar | Institutional Logic | Primary Objective | Key Actors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material** | **BRI** | Infrastructure Development | Physical Connectivity (Ports, Rail, Roads) | SOEs, State Banks, Ministries of Transport |
| **Commercial** | **DSR** | Digital Economy | Technological Ecosystems (5G, E-commerce, Fiber) | Tech Giants (Huawei, ZTE, Alibaba) |
| **Epistemic** | **DBAR** | **Big Earth Data Science** | **Standardisation & Science Diplomacy** | **Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), CBAS** |

### Why the Distinction Matters
While the **BRI** and **DSR** are often analysed through the lens of economic and security competition, the **DBAR** operates in the "Scientific" domain. Its influence is built on technical standards, shared satellite data, and joint research centres. For researchers, this represents a shift from *hard power* (ports) to *infrastructural power* (the ability to define how environmental and planetary data is collected, processed, and governed).

## Programmatic Overview: Institutional Persistence

The International Centres of Excellence (ICoEs) within the Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) programme represent long-term technical and institutional commitments between participating nations and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

These centres facilitate the integration of Earth Observation (EO) data into local and regional governance framework. By establishing standardised data sharing protocols and joint research agendas, the ICoE network serves as a durable infrastructure for global scientific collaboration. This repository serves as a neutral data point for tracking the evolution of these commitments and the technical standards that emerge from them.
