# DBAR Glossary: The Rosetta Stone of the Ecosystem

This glossary provides standardised definitions for the key institutional and technical components of the Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) programme.

## 🏛️ Institutional Entities

### CBAS
**International Research Centre of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals.**  
Established in Beijing in 2021, CBAS serves as the permanent Secretariat and scientific headquarters for DBAR. It provides the technological backbone, including cloud computing and data repositories, for the entire international network.

### ICoE (International Centre of Excellence)
Regional implementation nodes hosted by partner universities or research councils. ICoEs act as the physical interface between global DBAR data and local decision-making. Each ICoE typically leads a specific thematic area (e.g., ICoE-Helsinki leads Cold Regions research).

### WG (Working Group)
Thematic research groups dedicated to specific domains (e.g., DBAR-AGRI, DBAR-HERITAGE). While ICoEs are physical locations, Working Groups are collaborative networks that define the research agendas and technical standards for their respective fields.

## 🛰️ Technical Infrastructure

### SDGSAT-1
The **Sustainable Development Goals Satellite-1**, launched in November 2021. It is the first Earth observation satellite dedicated specifically to the UN 2030 Agenda. SDGSAT-1 provides high-resolution data for monitoring human-environment interactions (thermal infrared, low-light, and multi-spectral imaging).

### CASEarth
The **Big Earth Data Science Engineering Project**. This is the cloud platform and infrastructure that supports DBAR. It facilitates the storage, processing, and public sharing of planetary-scale datasets, allowing researchers to perform complex spatial analysis without local high-performance computing resources.

## 🌍 Programmatic Frameworks

### Digital Belt and Road (DBAR)
A scientific programme initiated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to improve data sharing and scientific collaboration. Unlike the economic-focused DSR, DBAR is strictly epistemic, focusing on environmental monitoring and sustainable development milestones.
